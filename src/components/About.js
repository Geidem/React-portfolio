        My name is Geofferey "Gibby" Eidem, I'm a 29 years old and I am looking to change career paths and explore the world of web development and coding. I have owned and operated my own business for the past 4 years, 
        yet I've always had a passion for technology and learning. Enrolling in the University of Utah's Coding Bootcamp has been a great experience so far and I am excited to see where this newfound knowledge will take me.
